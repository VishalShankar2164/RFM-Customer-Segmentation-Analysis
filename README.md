## RFM Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project delves into understanding customer purchasing behavior through the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. By analyzing customer data, we segment customers based on how recently they made a purchase, how frequently they make purchases, and how much they've spent.

### üèÜ Key Skills Demonstrated:

1. Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Handling missing values, adjusting data types, and ensuring clean datasets.
2. Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to create meaningful visualizations like histograms and heatmaps.
3. Customer Segmentation: Categorizing customers into groups such as "Champions" and "Lost" based on RFM scoring.
4. Pandas for Data Processing: Grouping, merging, and applying transformations on data using Pandas.

### üìÑ List of Key Analytical Steps

1. Loading Data: Importing and inspecting customer data.
2. Recency Calculation: Determining how long since each customer's last purchase.
3. Frequency Calculation: Counting the number of purchases for each customer.
4. Monetary Calculation: Summing up the total amount spent by each customer.
5. RFM Scoring: Assigning scores to Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
6. Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers into categories like "Champions" and "Lost" based on their RFM scores.
7. Visualization: Presenting the distribution of customer segments and location-based sales with bar plots and heatmaps.
